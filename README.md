**Buscacursos Webscraper**

A short program that allows PUC students to figure out how many vacancies are available in the courses they want to take. Writes the information into a new Excel file.

To change the courses that are analysed enter ```courses.py``` and edit the names and course codes.

This program only adds all vacancies, my goal is to differentiate these according to the different reserved vacancies available. Hopefully also highlight those available to the user.
